## Generated typescript endpoints for HighLevel v2 API

_NOTE_ the `typings` folder was generated by the typeconv library. The endpoints folder was generated by the openapi-typescript library.

## Scopes Builder

You can use the scopes builder to add scopes in a typesafe way, making sure your marketplace app and code match.

With the scopes builder you just provide the access type, and it will show you all of the available options for that access type.

```ts
const scopes = new ScopesBuilder()
scopes.add("businesses.readonly")
scopes.add("businesses.write")
// or you can add multiple at once
scopes.add([
    "businesses.readonly",
    "businesses.write",
    "calendars.readonly",
    ...
])
```

1.  Run the following in the developer console from the Highlevel Marketplace dashboard for your app:

    ```ts
    // https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/apps/<your app_id>/settings
    $$('.n-tag__content')
        .map((scope) => scope.textContent.trim())
        .toSorted()
    ```

2.  Copy the resulting array
3.  Create a new ScopesBuilder instance and paste the scopes to it.

    ```ts
    const scopes = new ScopesBuilder()
    scopes.add([
        "businesses.readonly",
        "businesses.write",
        "calendars.readonly",
        ...
    ])
    ```

4.  Call the `get` method to get the scopes string.

    ```ts
    scopes.get()
    ```
