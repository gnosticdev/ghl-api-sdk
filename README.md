# HighLevel API SDK

## Typed API Endpoints for HighLevel v2 API (oauth2)

_NOTE_ the `typings` folder was generated by the typeconv library. The endpoints folder was generated by the openapi-typescript library.

## Scopes Builder

You can use the scopes builder to add scopes in a typesafe way, making sure your marketplace app and code match.

With the scopes builder you just provide the access type, and it will show you all of the available options for that access type.

```ts
const scopes = new ScopesBuilder()
scopes.add("businesses.readonly")
scopes.add("businesses.write")
// or you can add multiple at once
scopes.add([
    "businesses.readonly",
    "businesses.write",
    "calendars.readonly",
    ...
])
```

### Collecting Scopes Helper

1. Once you have added your scopes to your app, you can collect them from the dev console on your app's settings page in the Highlevel Marketplace:

    ```ts
    // https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/apps/<your app_id>/settings
    $$('.n-tag__content')
        .map((scope) => scope.textContent.trim())
        .toSorted()
    ```

2. Copy the resulting array
3. Create a new ScopesBuilder instance and paste the scopes to it.

    ```ts
    const scopes = new ScopesBuilder()
    scopes.add([
        "businesses.readonly",
        "businesses.write",
        "calendars.readonly",
        ...
    ])
    ```

4. Call the `get` method to get the scopes string.

    ```ts
    scopes.get()
    ```
